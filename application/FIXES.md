# Application Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Theme Context Provider Error
**Error**: `useThemeMode must be used within ThemeModeProvider`

**Root Cause**: The [AnimatedThemeToggle](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/AnimatedThemeToggle.tsx#L140-L225) component was trying to use the [useThemeMode](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/Theme.tsx#L19-L23) hook outside of a `ThemeModeProvider` context.

**Solution**:
- Added [MaterialThemeProvider](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/Theme.tsx#L44-L91) to the global [Providers](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/context/Providers.tsx#L12-L22) component in `src/context/Providers.tsx`
- Removed duplicate theme providers from layout files since the context is now provided globally
- This ensures that the theme context is available throughout the entire application

### 2. Missing AUTH_SECRET Environment Variable
**Error**: `MissingSecret: Please define a 'secret'`

**Root Cause**: NextAuth.js requires a secret for signing cookies and encrypting JWT tokens, but it wasn't defined in the environment variables.

**Solution**:
- Generated a secure random secret using `openssl rand -base64 32`
- Added the secret to the `.env` file
- Set `BASE_URL` to `http://localhost:3004` to match the development server

### 3. Theme Toggle Positioning
**Requirement**: Position the theme toggle below the navbar at the top-right corner instead of using fixed positioning

**Solution**:
- Modified [AnimatedThemeToggle](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/AnimatedThemeToggle.tsx#L140-L225) component to accept flexible positioning props
- Updated layouts to use absolute positioning instead of fixed positioning
- Positioned the toggle at 16px from top and right within the content area
- This ensures the toggle appears below the navbar and scrolls with the content

### 4. Navbar Integration
**Requirement**: Move the theme toggle to the navbar itself, positioning it after the signup button

**Solution**:
- Integrated [AnimatedThemeToggle](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/AnimatedThemeToggle.tsx#L140-L225) directly into the [NavBar](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Public/NavBar/NavBar.tsx#L27-L156) component
- Removed standalone toggle instances from layouts
- Positioned the toggle within the navbar navigation items
- Shifted existing navigation links (Pricing, Login, Signup) to the left to accommodate the toggle

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/context/Providers.tsx`
- Added [MaterialThemeProvider](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/Theme.tsx#L44-L91) to the global providers chain
- This ensures theme context is available throughout the application

### 2. `src/app/(protected)/layout.tsx`
- Removed standalone [AnimatedThemeToggle](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/AnimatedThemeToggle.tsx#L140-L225) component
- Kept the [ThemePicker](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/ThemePicker.tsx#L23-L195) component for theme selection

### 3. `src/app/(public)/layout.tsx`
- Removed standalone [AnimatedThemeToggle](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/AnimatedThemeToggle.tsx#L140-L225) component
- The toggle is now integrated into the navbar

### 4. `src/components/Public/NavBar/NavBar.tsx`
- Added [AnimatedThemeToggle](file:///Users/sohumnikam/sea-notes-saas-starter-kit/application/src/components/Theme/AnimatedThemeToggle.tsx#L140-L225) component to the navbar
- Positioned the toggle after navigation links
- Shifted existing navigation links to the left

### 5. `src/components/Theme/AnimatedThemeToggle.tsx`
- Updated component to accept positioning props
- Changed default positioning from fixed to absolute
- Removed unused imports to fix linter errors

### 6. `.env`
- Added proper `AUTH_SECRET` generated with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- Set `BASE_URL` to match the development server port

## Remaining Development Warnings (Expected)

The following warnings are expected in a development environment and don't affect the core functionality:

1. **Database connection failed**: PostgreSQL server not running locally
2. **Storage connection failed**: DigitalOcean Spaces bucket not configured
3. **Email connection failed**: Resend API key not configured

These services can be configured properly in a production environment.

## Verification

The application now:
- Starts without theme context errors
- Has the animated theme toggle integrated into the navbar
- Properly handles authentication with the configured secret
- Positions navigation links to the left and the theme toggle to the right in the navbar
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding the new theme toggle feature

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3002`
3. Verify the animated theme toggle appears in the navbar (to the right of navigation links)
4. Click the toggle to switch between light and dark modes
5. Verify that the theme preference persists between page reloads
6. Verify that the toggle is visible on both public and protected pages
